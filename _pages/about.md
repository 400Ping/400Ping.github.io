I am a student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Yuan Ze University, also pursuing an cross-disciplinary program in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics. Throughout my journey, I have actively sought out opportunities to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the field.

One such opportunity was delivered a talk at COSCUP 2024, where I give introduction to RISC-V and shared my side projects, including one that applied RISC-V on the numerology of the Five Elements, and another that used RISC-V to calculate combinations and permutations.

I remain dedicated to continuously improving my academic and professional abilities, always seeking new challenges and learning opportunities in the rapidly evolving world of technology.
