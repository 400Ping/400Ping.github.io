I am a student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Yuan Ze University, also pursuing an interdisciplinary program in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics. Throughout my journey, I have actively sought out opportunities to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the field.

One such opportunity was serving as a Teaching Assistant at MY Camp, a collaborative program between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yuan Ze University. This experience not only enriched my knowledge but also provided valuable insights that have significantly shaped my academic and professional journey.

My passion for technology extends beyond the classroom. I was honored to speak at COSCUP 2024, where I shared my work on RISC-V and several side projects, including one that applied RISC-V on the numerology of the Five Elements, and another that used RISC-V to calculate combinations and permutations.

I remain dedicated to continuously improving my academic and professional abilities, always seeking new challenges and learning opportunities in the rapidly evolving world of technology.
